How to play:

  Play by entering keys and then pressing enter in the terminal. 
  
  You can move around, chop down trees, mine rocks and open the inventory.
  
  You can walk around with WASD keys and chain them to move multiple times. 
  For example to move up once you enter 'w' and press enter. But if you want to move up three tiles, you can eneter 'www' and press enter.
  
  To mine rocks or chop down trees you need to stand next to one and face the objects direction. Then enter 'e' and press enter. Trees and rocks do have hitpoints,
  so you'll need to use it multiple times.
